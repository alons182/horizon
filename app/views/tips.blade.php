       		<p>2. Communicate well with all parties involved before seeking apartment, house or a piece of property; this will save you any misunderstandings.  </p>

       		<p>4. If you plan to live in Guanacaste, a larger vehicle or a 4 Wheel Drive is recommended due to the conditions of the roads. </p>
       		<p>5. Be ready to make a quick decision, the market in this area is quite volatile, what's here today might not be there tomorrow.  </p>
